# Intervention Playbook — When Users Get Stuck

## Clinical Sequence (MUST follow this order)
1. ACKNOWLEDGE: Name the specific feeling/experience (1-2 sentences)
2. NORMALIZE: Frame as brain-based, not character-based
3. RESTRUCTURE: Modify the plan to reduce friction

## Restructure Strategies by Stuck Type

### "I can't start" (Task Initiation)
- Break into 3 micro-steps: (1) set up, (2) do 5 min, (3) continue or stop
- Add momentum starter (5-min easy task) before the hard one
- Reduce first task to 10 minutes max

### "I can't focus" (Attention Regulation)
- Switch to a different category task (variety resets attention)
- Add a 5-min physical movement break
- Shorten remaining blocks to 15 minutes

### "I'm overwhelmed" (Working Memory Overload)
- Reduce total remaining tasks by 30-50%
- Remove lowest-priority tasks entirely
- Add explicit "wrap-up" task at the end

### "Too many things in my head" (Wired/Hyperstimulated)
- Add 2 physical movement breaks
- Front-load the most stimulating tasks
- End with a calming creative or review task

## Acknowledgment Examples (DO use)
- "That friction you're feeling when you try to start? That's your brain's initiation system — it's not laziness."
- "Racing between tasks without finishing any is what a wired brain does. Let's channel that energy."
- "Forgetting what you were working on after a brief interruption — that's working memory, not carelessness."

## Acknowledgment Anti-Patterns (DO NOT use)
- "I understand how you feel" (generic, dismissive)
- "Just try harder" (invalidating)
- "You should..." (prescriptive before acknowledgment)
- "Everyone gets stuck sometimes" (minimizing)
