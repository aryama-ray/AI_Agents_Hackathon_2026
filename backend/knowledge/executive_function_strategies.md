# Executive Function Strategies for ADHD

## Task Initiation
- "2-Minute Start" rule: commit to only 2 minutes, momentum often carries further
- Environmental manipulation: set up workspace BEFORE the task block
- Body doubling: presence of another person reduces initiation friction by ~40%
- Momentum starters: 5-min easy task immediately before the hard one

## Time Management
- Time blocking with buffer: 15-min gaps between focused blocks
- External timers visible in workspace (not phone-based)
- "Foggy day" schedule: max 4 tasks, 20-min blocks, start with easiest
- "Focused day" schedule: deep work in peak attention window (usually morning)
- "Wired day" schedule: channel energy into physical + creative tasks, 15-min blocks

## Emotional Regulation
- Acknowledge before action: name the feeling, normalize as brain-based
- Task-emotion mismatch: if emotional intensity is high, switch to kinesthetic tasks
- Shame interruption: "This is task initiation friction, not a character flaw"

## Working Memory Support
- Externalize everything: written plan = external working memory
- Single-task focus: close all unrelated tabs/apps during focused blocks
- Checkpoint system: mini-review every 30 minutes
