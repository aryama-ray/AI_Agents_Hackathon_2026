# Brain State Research — Cognitive Performance by State

## Foggy State
- Characterized by: slow processing, difficulty initiating, low motivation
- Optimal task types: routine, admin, review (low cognitive load)
- Duration limit: 20 minutes per block before break
- Recovery strategy: physical movement, bright light, hydration
- Planning rule: start with easiest task, build momentum gradually

## Focused State
- Characterized by: clear thinking, sustained attention, good working memory
- Optimal task types: deep work, complex problem-solving, learning
- Duration capacity: 45-60 minute blocks
- Protection strategy: minimize interruptions, batch communications
- Planning rule: schedule hardest/most important task in this window

## Wired State
- Characterized by: restlessness, rapid task-switching, difficulty sitting still
- Optimal task types: physical tasks, short creative bursts, social interactions
- Duration limit: 15 minutes per block (attention shifts rapidly)
- Channeling strategy: use the energy productively, don't fight it
- Planning rule: more tasks with shorter durations, include 2+ movement breaks

## State Transitions
- Foggy to Focused: 30-60 min after wake + caffeine + movement
- Focused to Wired: often triggered by stimulating content or deadline pressure
- Wired to Foggy: energy crash after 2-3 hours of high output
- Pattern: post-lunch dip is universal — schedule easy tasks 1-2pm
